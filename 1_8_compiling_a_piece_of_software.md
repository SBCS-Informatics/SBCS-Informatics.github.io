## 8. Compiling a piece of software

Software for Unix systems is generally distributed as archives. To install a software package:

Download it (perhaps with `wget`). Then decompress it (perhaps with `unzip` or `gunzip`). Then check the installation instructions, usually in an `INSTALL` or `README` file. Often this will involve typing `make` in the directory. 

 Some readme files are more useful than others. If there is no help in the readme, but there is a file called 'makefile' in the directory, just type `make` and that should work.
