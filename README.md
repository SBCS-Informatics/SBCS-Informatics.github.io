This is a README explaining how to use the Apocrita HPC resource, along with a simple introduction to the command line etc. There will also be a slightly more advanced section with tips and tricks for the more seasoned user who has gotten to know Apocrita and Unix better.

Click on the menu on the left to navigate through the website.
