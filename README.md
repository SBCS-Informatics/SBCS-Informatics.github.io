#SBCS-Informatics

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sbcs-informatics/sbcs-informatics.github.io.svg?branch=src)](https://travis-ci.org/sbcs-informatics/sbcs-informatics.github.io)

This is a README explaining how to use the Apocrita HPC resource, along with a simple introduction to the command line etc. There is a slightly more advanced section with tips and tricks for the more seasoned user who has gotten to know Apocrita and Unix better.

If you have any questions please feel free to [contact us](3_0_contact.md).
